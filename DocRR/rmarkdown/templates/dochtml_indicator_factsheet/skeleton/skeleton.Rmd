##Relevance

This measure relates to indicator **Indicator name in bold**

##Accuracy

This measure complies with the <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/About.aspx#dataquality" target="_blank">data quality guidelines</a> used in New Zealand's Environmental Reporting framework.

##Outcomes Monitoring Framework

The Department of Conservation's (DOC's) Outcomes Monitoring Framework provides a platform on which DOC and others can assess outcomes in a clear, structured and transparent way [@lee2005biodiversity]. It has been developed as a logical hierarchy that is based on broad, overarching Outcomes, beneath which are nested Outcome Objectives, Indicators, Measures and Data Elements to provide ever increasing levels of detail. The framework is scalable, as the indicators and measures remain compatible and consistent whether applied locally, regionally or nationally. 
The recently updated framework provides a roadmap for gathering information to meet the specific objectives of DOC and other agencies [@mcglone2015]. The provision of a national framework with agreed outcomes, indicators and measures supports collaboration with land management and regulatory agencies, allowing for more integrated environmental policy and 'State of the Environment' reporting. DOC has partially implemented a national monitoring and reporting system, whereby priority indicators and measures are routinely used to report on progress against the objectives and outcomes. This factsheet reports on a measure for the 2015/16 year.

This repository contains a series of templates for creating HTML and PDF documents in R Markdown using the style themes employed by NZ Department of Conservation (DOC).

###Rmarkdown 

####Rmarkdown 

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for the analysis of data and reporting of results. You can use a single R Markdown file to both

* save and execute code.
* generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.


Download and open the ``.Rmd`` file from [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/demos/1-example.Rmd).


Notice that the file contains three types of content:

* An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ``---``s
* R code chunks surrounded by ```````s
* text mixed with simple text formatting.

You can also have in-line R code.

YAML, code chunks and in-line R code are described in more detail below.

#####YAML

At the top of the ``.Rmd`` file you downloaded you can see text in between ``---``:
```
---
title: "Viridis Demo"
output: html_document
---

```
This is called the YAML header. YAML is a simple text-based format for specifying data. In R Markdown documents YAML can be used for specifying the document metadata (title, author, date). This can be done as below:

```
---
title: "Viridis demo"
author: "Your name"
date: "3 Feb 2017"
output: html_document
---
```
The final document will then contain a nicely formated title, along with the author name and date.

You can leave off the author and date if you want; you can leave off the title, too. Actually, you don’t need to include any of this. But ``output: html_document`` tells the rmarkdown package to convert the document to html. Similarly ``output: pdf_document`` or even ``output: word_document``, in which case your document will be converted to a PDF or Word `.docx` file, respectively.

YAML becomes important later when we want to convert between document formats and customise our documents.


#####Code chunks

A key motivation for using R Markdown is facilitating reproducible research and reporting: that our results are accompanied by the data and code needed to produce them.

One of the powerful aspects of R Markdown is that you can incorporate your analysis and output in R (or other languages) directly into your reporting. One of the ways this is achieved is through code 'chunks' containing R code.

Code chunks look like this:


```{r simulate_data, eval=FALSE}
{r makesomedata}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
```


When you process the R Markdown document, each of the code chunks will be evaluated, and then the code and/or output will be inserted (unless you suppress one or both with chunk options). If the code produces a figure, that figure will be inserted.

It’s usually best to give each code chunk a name, like ``rat_graph`` and ``RTC_table``. The name is optional; if included, each code chunk needs a distinct name. The advantage of giving each chunk a name is that it will be easier to understand where to look for errors, should they occur. Also, any figures or tables that are created will be given names based on the name of the code chunk that produced them.

An R Markdown document will have often have many code chunks. They are evaluated in order, in a single R session, and the state of the various variables in one code chunk are preserved in future chunks.

#####In-line code

The other way of incorporating R code directly into your reporting is through 'in-line' code. This is not an alternative to using code chunks. The 2 methods serve different purposes. For instance you would not produce a graph or figure using in-line code. This is done through using code chunks as described above.

In-line code is used for incorporating numbers derived from data directly into your writing. Thus, your report should never explicitly include numbers that are derived from the data. Don’t write “There are 168 individuals.” Rather, insert a bit of code that, when evaluated, gives the number of individuals.

Rmarkdown enables this through using R code directly in your text. Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a ``.Rmd`` file by enclosing the code with `r`. 

To write "there are 168 individuals" using in-line code you would do this:

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
There are `r nrow(my_data)` individuals.

```

Another example:

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
The estimated correlation between x and y was `r cor(x,y)`.
```

In R Markdown, in-line code is indicated with `` `r`` and `` ` ``. The bit of R code between them is evaluated and the result inserted.

R Markdown will display the results of in-line code, but not the code itself. In-line code is used to insert information in your document where needed to enable easy updating of the document when new data becomes available. 

####Markdown basics

The following is a brief introduction to some of the basics of writing and producing tables and figures in R Markdown. For more detailed documentation download and use the [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) and [R Markdown reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

#####Writing text

An advantage of markdown is that it is a really simple typesetting language.

To make text **bold** use 2 ``**`` either side of your text (``**bold**``).

To make _italics_ use '_' either side of the text you want ``_italicized_``.

See the [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) for instructions for other aspects of writing such as creating bullet points etc.

#####Tables

Making and displaying tables in R Markdown is really easy. If working with data and wanting to display a table we can use the ``kable`` function from the ``knitr`` package like this:

```{r kable table, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

knitr::kable(head(iris,10)) #Display the first 10 rows of the dataset

```

Putting the package name before a command followed by ``::`` as above ``knitr::`` is an easy way of calling a package.

``kable`` works really well with HTML or PDF output and for simple tables. It also works really well in this type of workflow where you have your analysis in the same workflow and you need to output a summary table.

If displaying solely in HTML the ``DT`` library has some good options for displaying more complex data.

```{r DT table}
require(DT)
datatable(iris)

```

You'll see that ``DT`` tables have more options for filtering and searching data. This can be helpful if you have a more complicated table you want to show. ``DT`` tables don't work if you want a PDF report.

You can also generate a table in straight markdown.

This looks like this:

```
| Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width | Species |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.0         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.6         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.4          | 3.9         | 1.7          | 0.4         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.4         | 1.4          | 0.3         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.4         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.4          | 2.9         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.1         | setosa  |
```

But renders in HTML like this:

| Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width | Species |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.0         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.6         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.4          | 3.9         | 1.7          | 0.4         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.4         | 1.4          | 0.3         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.4         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.4          | 2.9         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.1         | setosa  |

The website [http://www.tablesgenerator.com/](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/) is really useful for converting tables between different formats. The advantage of using markdown format is that it gives more flexibility for situations where you may need to to more editing inside a table, such as adding footnotes which you would do like this:

```
| Sepal.Length [^1] | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width | Species |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.0         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.6         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.4          | 3.9         | 1.7          | 0.4         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.4         | 1.4          | 0.3         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.4         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.4          | 2.9         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.1         | setosa  |
Table (\#tab:markdowntable): A table about some sort of flower

[^1]: A footnote about Sepal length
```

Which looks like Table \@ref(tab:markdowntable):


| Sepal.Length [^1] | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width | Species |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.0         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.6         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 5.4          | 3.9         | 1.7          | 0.4         | setosa  |
| 4.6          | 3.4         | 1.4          | 0.3         | setosa  |
| 5.0          | 3.4         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.4          | 2.9         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |
| 4.9          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.1         | setosa  |
Table (\#tab:markdowntable): A table about some sort of flower


[^1]: A footnote about Sepal length



#####Figures

When writing a report in Microsoft Word or similar and you want to display graphs and figures you have to generally copy and paste plots manually into your document. This lends itself to making mistakes and becomes tedious when your data/presentation changes. 

Using R Markdown, R (or other language) and ``knitr`` it is really easy to place your figure in your work exactly where you want it to go. If your data changes then it is as simple as ensuring your new data is called to update your figure. Figure \@ref(fig:flowers) tells us simple things about the ``iris`` dataset.

```{r flowers, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= 'Something to do with flowers', fig.height=3,fig.width=5}

plot(iris)

```

#####References and citations

R Markdown will automatically produce a bibliography from in-line citations. By default the ``DocRR`` package uses ``bibtex`` citations as the default format. When a template is saved a ``.bib`` file is automatically added to the folder structure. This can be thought of as a reference database much like Endnote or Mendeley, indeed Endnote/Mendely libraries can usually be exported to ``bibtex``. Each reference cited needs to have an entry in the ``.bib`` file. An easy way to get the ``bibtex`` format for citations is to use [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.nz/). Search for an article, click on 'Cite' then click on 'BibTeX' (Figure \@ref(fig:googlescholar)). Copy and paste the result into your ``.bib`` file.

```{r googlescholar, fig.cap = "The 'Cite' dialog box in Google Scholar.",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("googlescholar.png")
```

You can now refer to this within your document. 

Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. Here are some examples:
```
Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].
```
To do an inline citation do the following:

```
@smith04 says blah.

@smith04 [p. 33] says blah.
```
When you cite something using the ``@`` symbol and the citation identifier i.e. ``@smith04`` it will automatically appear in the document bibliograhy. The bibliography will automatically appear at the end of the document. If you finish each document with ``##References`` then the bibliography will appear below the header.

#####Custom templates

It is possible to create custom made templates for PDF and HTML documents in R Markdown. Using a custom made template means the author can produce a fully reproducible document using the correct styling for your organisation.

The ``DocRR`` package contains templates for reproducible reporting for the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC). The following sections will get you started with the package and walk you through producing PDF and HTML documents from R Markdown. 

###DocRR package

``DocRR`` stands for DOC Reproducible Research as the ``DocRR`` package has been made to enable DOC staff to produce high quality documents in PDF and HTML formats which can be easily updated and reproduced. Using ``DocRR`` templates means there is no need to bother with manual formatting of Microsoft Word documents or copying and pasting of graphs and figures. 

####Getting started


In order for PDF output to work you need to make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed. [MiKTEX](https://miktex.org/) is the most common distribution to use.

####Installing the package


First off install the ``devtools`` package if you haven't already.

Paste the code into your R console and run it:

````
install.packages("devtools")

````

Now install the ``DocRR`` package using: 

````
devtools::install_github('ogansell/DocRR')

````

####Creating a template in RStudio


RStudio supports these templates natively.You can download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

If using RStudio you can now load pre-made templates for outputting analysis and reporting in HTML or PDF format. To do this go to
_File>New File>RMarkdown_ (Figure \@ref(fig:rmarkdown1)).


```{r rmarkdown1, fig.cap = "Opening a new rmarkdown file within RStudio.",echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.height=8}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown1.bmp")
```



From here you can now load any one of the templates by selecting 
_RMarkdown>From Template_ and selecting any one of the templates under ``DocRR``.

Select the template you want to load, give it a name and save it (Figure \@ref(fig:rmarkdown3)). 


```{r rmarkdown3, fig.cap = "The dialog box for saving a template.",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown3.bmp")
```


Important to note here is that when you save your file a folder structure for your file is automatically made. This is because the templates have some extra files they are dependant on in order to compile (Figure \@ref(fig:rmarkdown4)).


```{r rmarkdown4, fig.cap = "The folder structure automatically created when a template is loaded.",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown4.bmp")
```



You've now got a template for producing a PDF report to begin working on (Figure \@ref(fig:rmarkdown8)).
Press the knit button to have a look at what it produces. 

```{r rmarkdown8, fig.cap = "A loaded rmarkdown template",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown8.bmp")
```


####After installation


When making PDF or HTML documents a common intermediate step is to ``knit`` your document to ``.docx`` format. This makes it easy to send to reviewers to get their input. The [webshot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/webshot/vignettes/intro.html) package is useful in this instance as it includes a screenshot of any htmlwidgets used in the knitted ``.docx`` file. It requires installation of the PhantomJS software. This causes installation of the ``DocRR`` package to fail on older installations of R so it is recommended to install this manually after installing ``DocRR``. Do this by running the code:

```
webshot::install_phantomjs()
```


####Creating a template outside of RStudio

If you're not using RStudio it's still easy to use these templates in base R.

Wrapper functions have been made to make it easy to load a template.

There is one function for each template. The document names are examples only, you can name the ``".Rmd"`` file whatever you like.

Functions below:

``DocRR::article("myarticle.Rmd")``
``DocRR::article_book("myarticle.Rmd")``
``DocRR::report("myreport.Rmd")``
``DocRR::report_book("myreport.Rmd")``
``DocRR::plain_html("myplainwebpage.Rmd")``
``DocRR::tab_html("mytabbedwebpage.Rmd")``
``DocRR::indicator_html("myindicatorfactsheet.Rmd")``

To compile your document use: 

```
rmarkdown::render("my_article/my_article.Rmd")

``` 

Remember that you need to point it to the right directory, which means you need to include the folder which was automatically created to host your ``".Rmd"`` file.

####Extra information

You can now start making documents using these templates. It's important to remember that each template has been designed for a specific output (i.e. PDF articles or reports, plain webpages, web pages with tabbed layout or standardised pages for reporting on biodiversity indicators). Therefore the ``docarticle`` or ``docreport`` templates won't work for making webpages and HTML templates won't work for generating PDF documents. Saying that, all of the templates will output to ``.docx`` (word format) provided some of the YAML metadata is altered (we'll cover this later). This is useful for giving reviewers who aren't familiar with R or R Markdown a version of your document for editing and making comments. 

You'll see there are 2 versions of the article and report PDF templates (i.e. ``docarticle`` and ``docarticle_bookdown``). The ``bookdown`` package adds the extra utility of cross referencing tables and figures in text. This is especially handy for scientific/technical publications with lots of tables and graphs, but is also useful for images etc. 

Using the ``bookdown`` templates seems to cause some problems when knitting documents on some computers, so article and report templates have been included which do not use the ``bookdown`` package. Guidance on how to cross-reference using ``bookdown`` has been provided in each of the templates.To learn more about ``bookdown`` go to [https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).


###Changing colours

####Changing colours


The templates in this package have all of the style elements needed to adjust the colour of banners or fonts according to the DOC style guidelines. There are 7 different colours to use for banners at the top of the first page and for text headings.  

Changing colours in PDF or HTML documents normally requires some working knowledge of LaTeX, HTML and CSS code. To make life easier for users of this package functions have been defined in R to allow the user to easily choose whatever colour is required for banners and fonts in both web and PDF output. The colours for banners and fonts are shown in the table below. Beside each colour you can see the function for the banners for PDF articles and reports and for HTML documents. There is also a function for specifying the colour of headings for HTML documents. A different approach is used for colour of headings for PDF documents.

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-size:16px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}

###PDF output

####PDF output

Producing a PDF document from R Markdown requires LaTeX be installed on your computer.As above, we recommend [MiKTEX](https://miktex.org/). Knitting to PDF can be a bit tricky at first. Behind the scenes a programme called ``pandoc`` is converting your ``.Rmd`` document into a LaTeX document. LaTeX requires packages of it's own to do various tasks involved in producing the document. To get started you will need to ensure that MiKTEX can access it's package repository through the DOC proxy server.

If you've got MiKTEX installed search for and open the ``MiKTEX Package Manager`` in your program files (Figure \@ref(fig:miktex)).


```{r miktex, fig.cap= "The MiKTEX Package Manager dialog box.", echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.height=8}
knitr::include_graphics("miktex.jpg")
```

Click on ``Repository`` then ``Change Package Repository`` (Figure \@ref(fig:packagerepo)).

```{r packagerepo, fig.cap= "The MiKTEX Change Package Repository dialog box.", echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.height=8}
knitr::include_graphics("packagerepo.jpg")
```


Now click on ``Connection Settings`` (Figure \@ref(fig:connectionsettings)),

Add a tick to 'Use a proxy server' and add ``webproxy`` to the ``Address:`` box and ``8080`` to the ``Port:`` box. If you're working off the DOC system then you'll need to untick 'Use a proxy server` for everything to work.


```{r connectionsettings, fig.cap= "The MiKTEX Connection Settings dialog box.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("connectionsettings.jpg")
```

Now you're ready to start working on a document templates. Follow the instructions under the [Getting started](#getting-started) to open one of the PDF templates ``docarticle`` or ``docreport`` or one of the ``bookdown`` versions. 

Figure \@ref(fig:yaml) shows one of the templates to produce a PDF document. All of the text between the ``---`` lines is known as YAML. YAML was mentioned previously and is essentially the document metadata and tells ``pandoc`` and therefore LaTeX everything it needs to know to produce the document. Don't worry too much about how it works.  

```{r yaml, fig.cap= "YAML heading in 'docarticle' PDF template", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pdf.jpg")
```

In the YAML section you can see some notation such as ``\LARGE`` and ``\large`` . This is LaTeX code to specify the size of the title and subtitle. You can modify the titles and subtitles inserted there provided the ``\LARGE`` is at the front with a space between it and the actual title. Figure \@ref(fig:fontsize) shows the LaTeX commands for different font sizes. These can be used for changing font sizes for the title and subtitle in the YAML section.

```{r fontsize, fig.cap= "LaTeX commands for changing font size.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fontsize.png")
```

Now we can specify the colour of the banner and font headers for the document. ``Lake`` has been set as the default colour. Where we see this in the YAML header:
````
#This section contains raw LATEX code and shouldn't be altered
header-includes:
#--------------------Define color for use here-----------------#
- \newcommand{\mycolor}{\color{Lake}}  #Define color for use here
- \ThisULCornerWallPaper{1}{{r DocRR::Lake()}}
#-----------------------END-------------------------------------#
````
We can see 2 LaTeX commands defined:

```{r eval = FALSE}
\newcommand{\mycolor}{\color{Lake}}
``` 

controls the colour for the font headings and: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
\ThisULCornerWallPaper{1}{{`r DocRR::Lake()`}}

``` 

controls the colour of the banner. To change your colours simply add a different colour at

```{r eval=FALSE}
\newcommand{\mycolor}{\color{----}} and \ThisULCornerWallPaper{1}{{`r DocRR::----()`}}
``` 

from one of the colour options in Table \@ref(tab:colours). Make sure not to change any of the other text otherwise the functions will not run successfully.

Now have a play with changing your colours and font size for titles and subtitles. If you have a really long title or subtitle it can push the  location of the author and date down the page. The best approach to manage this is to change the font size of your title and subtitle as needed to control how it influences the overall layout.

####Knitting to PDF

When you first knit to PDF ``pandoc`` converts the ``.Rmd`` document into a ``.tex`` LaTeX document which is then compiled to make a PDF article or report. As mentioned before, LaTeX uses packages to help carry out various tasks involved in compiling a document. When you first start making PDF documents MiKTEX will need to download and install the necessary packages. You'll need to approve each download or untick the box. 

__Insert photo of dialog box__

Sometimes documents fail to compile because MiKTEX can't download the necessary packages. When this happens you'll see an error message as in Figure \@ref(fig:packageerror). The best thing to do here is to try 'knitting' several times, as often the package will download after a few attempts. If this still doesn't work you may need to try a different package repository in MiKTEX or download the package manually.

```{r packageerror, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Error message when packages fail to download." }

knitr::include_graphics("packageerror.png")

```



###HTML output

####HTML output

Generally making an HTML document requires some knowloedge of HTML and CSS code. HTML tells a webpage how it is structured and CSS tells a web page how each of the various elements defined in the HTML code are supposed to look. The ``DocRR`` package contains 3 HTML document templates. All of them contain a little bit of HTML and CSS, however you don't need to know much about this in order to use these templates. Figure \@ref(fig:htmltemplate) shows one of the html templates from the ```DocRR`` package.  

```{r htmltemplate, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Error message when packages fail to download." }

knitr::include_graphics("htmltemplate.png")

```

You can see that there is some text in between the ``<`` and ``>`` symbols. This is HTML code and the ``< >`` symbols are known as tags. ``< >`` opens a tag and ``</>`` closes a tag. So where you see ``<h1>Title of page</h1>`` is where the title of the page should go because ``h1`` stands for the highest order in a series of headers. So if you want to change the title for this document simply put what ever text you want in between the ``< >`` tags ``<h1>A different title</h1>``. Provided the ``<h1>`` and ``</h1>`` are left unchanged everything should work fine. HTML code has been used in this instance as it works better with the design of the templates and the CSS developed to go along with it. 

CSS controls the style elements for the HTML document. If you know CSS you could change the look and feel of the font or table layouts for th document. However the ``DocRR`` templates have tried to minimise the amount of HTML or CSS the user needs to learn. In the section below the header you can see the code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<!--Add some custom css to control font and table header colour or other style components where needed-->
<style> 
        h2 {color: `r DocRR::font_Lake()`}
        h3 {color: `r DocRR::font_Lake()`}
        h4 {color: `r DocRR::font_Lake()`}
        th {background-color : `r DocRR::font_Lake()`}
</style>

```
This sets the color for the font for each level of section header and background for any table headers. In HTML code this is shown by ``h2 h3 h4 th`` and translates to ``# ## ### ####`` in ``markdown`` text. The colour is set using CSS which is set in between the ``{ }`` after each section header i.e. ``h2``. Normally you would need to know different __HEX__ codes for each colour which would look like ``#FFFF00``. To make things easier wrapper functions have been defined to make it easy to choose different colours for the headings of HTML documents. So if you want to change your ``h2`` headers from <span style="color:`r DocRR::font_Lake()`">Lake</span> to <span style="color:`r DocRR::font_Alpine()`">Alpine</span>
simply refer to the functions from change Table \@ref(tab:colours) and change the name of the colour in the function 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r DocRR::font_Lake()`
``` 

to 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r DocRR::font_Alpine()`
```

To change the colour of the banner use the functions defined for changing the colour of web banners (Table \@ref(tab:colours)).  


###Word output

####Word output

There are no word templates established for this package, namely because working in Word does't lend itself to a reprodueable workflow. However Word (``.docx``) output is useful for sharing your work with others for the purposes of peer review and comment as many people are not familiar with working in ``rmarkdown``. 

Word versions of PDF or HTML templates can be easily produced using ``rmarkdown``. They do not have any style elements applied and should be used for getting feedback and review from others. Once you have all the feedback you need any changes should be incorporated back into your ``".Rmd"`` document. 

In order to produce ```.docx`` documents from any of the ``DocRR`` templates you need to remove some ``#`` from some of the YAML header and add ``#`` to other section of the YAML header. The ``#`` symbol tells R to ignore any content beginning in or following ``#``.

Look in the YAML header for the following:

````

#------------If wanting word  or html  versions uncomment either one below--------#
  # word_document: default 
  # html_document: default
#-------Make sure to comment out everything below if using word or html above-----#
  pdf_document:
    keep_tex: false #Only have true if you want to keep the latex file produced
    latex_engine: xelatex #Has to be xelatex to use Archer fonts
    template: doc_article.tex #Don't change this!!!
    toc: false  #include table of contents
    toc_depth: 1 #specify the depth of the table of contents
    number_sections: true #specify whether or not to add numbered sections
````
This tells ``pandoc`` that the ``.Rmd`` file is intended for producing a PDF document. If you want to produce a ``.docx`` document you need to remove the ``#`` symbol from ``word_document`` and add ``#`` symbols to everyline from ``pdf_document`` and down. So that section of the YAML would now look like this:

````
#------------If wanting word  or html  versions uncomment either one below--------#
  word_document: default 
  # html_document: default
#-------Make sure to comment out everything below if using word or html above-----#
  #pdf_document:
    #keep_tex: false #Only have true if you want to keep the latex file produced
    #latex_engine: xelatex #Has to be xelatex to use Archer fonts
    #template: doc_article.tex #Don't change this!!!
    #toc: false  #include table of contents
    #toc_depth: 1 #specify the depth of the table of contents
    #number_sections: true #specify whether or not to add numbered sections
````
This will now knit a ``.docx`` document. If you want to go back to PDF output you simply reverse the two steps just described.

Figure \@ref(fig:plot) is an example of a plotly plot.

```{r plot, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Interesting thingsa about diamonds."}

#Make a graph. Seen as this is an html page the plotly library makes nice interactive graphics

library(plotly)
set.seed(100)
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
plot_ly(d, x = ~carat, y = ~price, color = ~carat,
        size = ~carat, text = ~paste("Clarity: ", clarity))

```


<!-- An alternative way of adding captions. Only use if captions not working for some htmlwidgets. Otherwise delete. -->
<p class="caption" align = "left" id = "Figure 1."> Figure \@ref(fig:plot). Interesting things about diamonds</p>

Using this template we need to make sure that tables follow the 'stripeytables' class defined in the DOC css.

We do this by adding ``class = 'stripeytables'`` when we produce a table using either the ``knitr::kable`` or ``DT::datatable`` functions. Examples below in Tables \@ref(tab:iristab) and Table [2](irisDT1):

```{r iristab, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

knitr::kable(head(iris,15) , "html", table.attr='class="stripeytable"', caption = "The first 15 rows of the iris dataset.")

```

<!-- Cross-referencing doesn't work properly for DT tables so we need to make a hack.Add caption below then link to table section at next step.-->
<p class="caption" align = "left"> <span style="font-weight:bold">Table 2. The first 15 rows of the iris dataset in a DT table.</span></p>
<!--This creates a linkn to the place where the table sites.-->
######{#irisDT1} 
```{r irisDT,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
DT::datatable(head(iris,15), class = "stripeytable", rownames = FALSE,
    option=list(columnDefs=list(list(targets=1:4, class="dt-right"))))#'targets=1:4' needs to be adjusted depending on the data presented 
```


##Definition and methodology

Describe the data and the methods

##Data quality
 
This measure is classified as a [case study](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/About.aspx#topics{:target="_blank"}).

##Relevance

This measure relates to indicator **Indicator name in bold**

##Accuracy

This measure complies with the <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/About.aspx#dataquality" target="_blank">data quality guidelines</a> used in New Zealand's Environmental Reporting framework.

##Outcomes Monitoring Framework

The Department of Conservation's (DOC's) Outcomes Monitoring Framework provides a platform on which DOC and others can assess outcomes in a clear, structured and transparent way [@lee2005biodiversity]. It has been developed as a logical hierarchy that is based on broad, overarching Outcomes, beneath which are nested Outcome Objectives, Indicators, Measures and Data Elements to provide ever increasing levels of detail. The framework is scalable, as the indicators and measures remain compatible and consistent whether applied locally, regionally or nationally. 
The recently updated framework provides a roadmap for gathering information to meet the specific objectives of DOC and other agencies [@mcglone2015]. The provision of a national framework with agreed outcomes, indicators and measures supports collaboration with land management and regulatory agencies, allowing for more integrated environmental policy and 'State of the Environment' reporting. DOC has partially implemented a national monitoring and reporting system, whereby priority indicators and measures are routinely used to report on progress against the objectives and outcomes. This factsheet reports on a measure for the `r as.integer(format(Sys.Date(),"%Y"))-1`/`r format(Sys.Date(),"%Y")` year.
